RIL Marker Parser v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program description:

This program skeletonizes a set of molecular markers for a RIL mapping population via
the following process:

1.  Remove all markers with unacceptable levels of missing data (user-specified)
2.  Remove all markers which introduce double crossovers (DCO's) into the genetic
	linkage map
3.  Scan the remaining genetic map using a window of assignable size (cM) and select one
	marker to represent each window on the basis of two criteria:
		a.  Maximum number of underlying markers completely linked to the marker
		b.  Minimum amount of missing data associated with the marker


To use, place the file ril_marker_parser.pl in the same directory as the input file and run.
Command line example:

>perl ril_marker_parser.pl


When run, the program will prompt you for the name of the input file.  The input file
should be comma-delimited and of the following format:

marker_name_1,chromosome,missing_data,position(cM),linked_markers,A,B,A,B,etc.
marker_name_2,chromosome,missing_data,position(cM),linked_markers,A,B,A,B,etc.
etc.

NOTES:
missing_data = The number of RILs missing data for that marker
linked_markers = The number of underlying loci completely linked to that marker
There should be no column headers in the input file!
Marker names cannot contain commas!
Markers should be in map order!


For example, if you had only 7 RILs, you may have lines like these:

IWB9867,1A,2,0,2,A,B,B,-,A,B,-
IWB16714,1A,1,1.6,4,A,-,B,A,A,B,B
etc.


When run, the script will prompt you for information, via the following questions:

1.  What is the symbol used for missing data?
	(e.g. -,.,etc.)
2.  Delete markers with more than how many missing data points [RILs]?
	(e.g. 1,5,10,etc.)
3.  Delete markers if and only if an acceptable marker is within how many cM?
	(e.g. 0.5,1,1.5,etc.)
4.  Search for DCO's within a window length of what size [cM]?
	(e.g. 0.5,1,1.5,etc.)
5.  Choose the size [cM] of the scanning window
	(e.g. 1,2,5,etc.)
6.  Provide a filename for the tab-delimited results
